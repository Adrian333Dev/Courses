# Popular RPC Frameworks and Technologies

## [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)

[gRPC](https://grpc.io/) is a modern open source high performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework. It was originally developed by Google in 2015 as the next generation of its own internal RPC infrastructure.

It uses [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) as its transport protocol and [Protocol Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/) as its **_Interface Description Language_**.

_gRPC_ currently supports the following languages:

- [C#](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/csharp/)
- [C++](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/cpp/)
- [Dart](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/dart/)
- [Go](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/)
- [Java](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/java/)
- [Kotlin](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/kotlin/)
- [Node.js](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/node/)
- [Objective-C](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/objectivec/)
- [PHP](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/php/)
- [Python](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/)
- [Ruby](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/ruby/)

## [Apache Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/)

[Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) is a lightweight, language-independent software stack for point-to-point RPC.

Thrift makes it easy for programs written in different programming languages to share data and call remote procedures since it [supports more than 28 languages](https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/LANGUAGES.md), including C++, Java, Python, Go, Scala, Swift, PHP, Ruby, Perl, C#, JavaScript, Node.js, and other languages.

Thrift was created at Facebook for "scalable cross-language services development". It uses its own _Interface Description Language_ called [Thrift interface description language](https://thrift.apache.org/docs/idl).

A full tutorial for all the supported languages can be found [here](https://thrift.apache.org/tutorial/).

## [Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/rmi/)

Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) is an RPC framework that allows one Java virtual machine to invoke methods on an object running in another Java virtual machine.

RMI uses Java as the _Interface Description Language_.

You can find the full tutorial [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/rmi/).
