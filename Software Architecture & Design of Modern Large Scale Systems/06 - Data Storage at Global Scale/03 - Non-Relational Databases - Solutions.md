# Non-Relational Databases - Solutions

## Key/Value Stores

- [Redis](https://redis.io/): An open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. Redis supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, and streams.
- [Aerospike](https://aerospike.com/): A high-performance, distributed NoSQL database built for speed at scale. Aerospike is optimized for flash storage and provides strong consistency, high availability, and low latency.
- [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/): A fully managed NoSQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services. DynamoDB is designed for applications that require single-digit millisecond latency and can scale to handle massive workloads across multiple regions.

## Document Store

- [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html): A highly scalable, distributed NoSQL database that provides high availability with no single point of failure. Cassandra is designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/document-databases): A popular open-source document database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents that can vary in structure.

## Graph Databases

- [Amazon Neptune](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/): A fully managed graph database service provided by Amazon Web Services. Neptune supports both property graph and RDF graph models and is optimized for storing and querying highly connected data.
- [NEO4J](https://neo4j.com/): An open-source graph database that is optimized for querying and managing highly connected data. NEO4J uses a native graph storage and processing engine to efficiently handle complex graph queries.
