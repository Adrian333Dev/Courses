# System Requirements

## Feature Requirements

- **Requirement Gathering Steps**
  1. Identify all the actors/users in our system
  2. Capture and describe all the possible use cases/scenarios
  3. Use Flow - Expand each use case through flow of events.
     - **Each event contains**
       - **Action**
       - **Data**

## System Quality Attributes Requirements

- **System Quality Attributes**
  - Privide a quality measure of how well our system performs on a particular dimension.
  - Have a direct correlation with the architecture of our system.
- **Important Considerations**
  - Testability and Measurability
  - **Trade-offs**
    - No single architecture can provide all the quality attributes.
    - Certain quality attributes contradict one another.
    - Some combinations of quality attributes are very hard/impossible to achieve.
  - **Feasibility**
    - We need to make sure that the system is capable of delivering what clients are asking for.

## System Constraints in Software Architecture

- **Definition**
  - A system constraint is essentially a decision that was already either fully or partially made for us, restricting our degrees of freedom.
- **Types of Constraints**
  - Technical constraints
  - Business constraints
    - System Constraints in Software Architecture
      - **Architecture**
      - **Implementation**
  - Regulatory/legal constraints
    - **Global**
    - **Specific to a region**
- **Considerations**
  - We shouldn't take any given constraint lightly
  - Use loosely coupled architecture
