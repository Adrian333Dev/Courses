# System Constraints in Software Architecture

## Understanding System Constraints

- **Definition:** System constraints are decisions that have already been made, restricting the degrees of freedom in designing the system architecture.
- **Types of Constraints:**
  - **Technical Constraints:** Hardware, cloud vendors, programming languages, databases, supported platforms, etc.
  - **Business Constraints:** Budget limitations, deadlines, third-party service integrations, etc.
  - **Legal Constraints:** Regulations like HIPAA (healthcare) or GDPR (data privacy) that dictate certain architectural decisions.

## Impact on Software Architecture

- Constraints can significantly affect architectural decisions, sometimes limiting the available options for achieving desired quality attributes.
- For example, on-premise hosting might limit the use of cloud-native features, and supporting older browsers may require adjustments in web architecture.

## Considerations When Dealing with Constraints

1. **Evaluate the Realness of Constraints:**

   - Distinguish between non-negotiable constraints and those that might be negotiable or removable.
   - Explore opportunities to negotiate or remove self-imposed constraints for the benefit of the project.

2. **Design for Future Flexibility:**
   - Avoid tight coupling with specific technologies or services to allow for easier changes in the future.
   - Use architectural building blocks and techniques that enable parts of the system to be independently updated or replaced.

## Key Takeaways

- System constraints provide a starting point and framework for architectural decisions but can also limit flexibility.
- It's crucial to critically assess constraints and design the architecture with future adaptability in mind, allowing for potential changes in constraints without the need for a complete redesign.

In this lecture, the concept of system constraints as a crucial architectural driver was explored, highlighting the importance of evaluating and accommodating these constraints in the design of software architecture while maintaining the ability to adapt to future changes.
