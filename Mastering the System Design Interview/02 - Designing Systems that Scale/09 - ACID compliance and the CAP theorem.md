# ACID compliance and the CAP theorem

ACID compliance and the CAP theorem are fundamental concepts in the design and implementation of databases, especially in the context of scalable systems.

ACID compliance refers to a set of properties that guarantee the reliability of transactions in a database:

1. **Atomicity**: Ensures that either all operations within a transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are. This means that if one part of a transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, ensuring that the database remains in a consistent state.

2. **Consistency**: Guarantees that the database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction. This means that all data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, and triggers.

3. **Isolation**: Ensures that the execution of transactions concurrently does not result in data corruption or inconsistencies. Each transaction should appear to be executed in isolation, even though they may be executed concurrently.

4. **Durability**: Guarantees that once a transaction is committed, it will persist, even in the event of a system failure. This typically involves writing the transaction's changes to a persistent storage medium, such as disk.

The CAP theorem, on the other hand, states that it is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:

1. **Consistency**: Every read receives the most recent write or an error.

2. **Availability**: Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent write.

3. **Partition tolerance**: The system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning (network failures) between nodes.

In a distributed system, when there is a network partition (a communication break between two sets of nodes), you must choose between consistency and availability. You can either decide to provide a consistent system (where all nodes see the same data at the same time, sacrificing availability during network partitions) or an available system (where all nodes are able to respond to read and write requests, potentially returning stale data, sacrificing consistency).

Different database systems make different trade-offs between these properties based on the needs of the application. For example, traditional relational databases like MySQL or Oracle typically prioritize consistency and durability, while NoSQL databases like Cassandra or MongoDB often prioritize availability and partition tolerance. However, many modern databases aim to provide a balance of these properties, depending on the use case and configuration.
