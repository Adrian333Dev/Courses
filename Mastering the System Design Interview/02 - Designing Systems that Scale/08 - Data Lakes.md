# Data Lakes

In the context of designing systems that scale, particularly in the realm of big data, the concept of a "data lake" is often used. A data lake is essentially a large repository where raw data is stored in its native format until it's needed. This raw data can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured, and it's typically stored in a distributed file system like Amazon S3.

The idea behind a data lake is to have a centralized location where all types of data can be stored without the need to structure it upfront. This contrasts with traditional databases where data needs to be structured before it's stored. With a data lake, you can store large amounts of raw data and then apply structure to it as needed for analysis or other purposes.

Amazon Glue is a service provided by AWS that helps to impart structure onto the data stored in the data lake. It does this by crawling the data and extracting a schema, which allows you to query the data using SQL as if it were in a database. This structured data can then be queried using tools like Amazon Athena, which provides a SQL interface to the data in S3.

Amazon Redshift is another service provided by AWS that can be used in conjunction with a data lake. Redshift is a distributed data warehouse that allows you to run complex queries on large datasets. Redshift Spectrum is a feature of Redshift that allows you to query data directly in S3 without having to load it into Redshift first.

In summary, a data lake is a storage system for raw data that allows you to apply structure to the data as needed. Services like AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, and Amazon Redshift can be used to work with data lakes and perform analysis on the data stored within them.
