## **Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Frequencies**

Wi-Fi utilizes the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz microwave radio frequency bands to send and receive data. The key differences and characteristics of these frequency bands are:

### 2.4 GHz

**Advantages:**

- **Long Signal Range:** Up to 150 feet (45 meters) indoors and 300 feet (92 meters) outdoors.
- **Penetration:** Can pass through walls and other solid objects.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Interference:** Susceptible to interference from other devices and technologies, including Bluetooth and microwave ovens.
- **Limited Channels:** Typically offers 11 to 14 channels, leading to potential congestion.
- **Security Risk:** Longer range increases the risk of interception.
- **Maximum Data Rate:** Up to 600 Mbps under specific conditions.

### 5 GHz

**Advantages:**

- **More Channels:** Offers significantly more channels than 2.4 GHz, reducing interference.
- **Higher Data Rates:** Can achieve data transfer speeds over 2 Gbps under specific conditions.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Limited Range:** Up to 50 feet (12 meters) indoors and 100 feet (30 meters) outdoors.
- **Limited Penetration:** Less effective at passing through walls and solid objects compared to 2.4 GHz.
