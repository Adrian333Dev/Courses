# Supplemental Reading for WAN Protocols

## WAN Protocols Overview

Wide Area Networks (WANs) are crucial for connecting geographically dispersed networks, often using Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for security. WAN configurations are essential for IT support professionals managing large organizations' networks.

## **Physical vs. Software-Based WANs**

### WAN Router

- **Function**: Routes data among LAN groups in a WAN using a private connection.
- **Types**: Known as border routers or edge routers.
- **Interfaces**:
  - Digital modem interface (WAN, OSI link layer)
  - Ethernet interface (LAN)

### Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN)

- **Purpose**: Addresses cloud-based WAN needs.
- **Benefits**:
  - Simplifies WAN implementation, management, and maintenance.
  - Reduces costs by replacing expensive leased lines.
- **Use**: Can be used with or without traditional WANs.

## **WAN Optimization Techniques**

### Compression

- **Goal**: Reduce file sizes for efficient network traffic.
- **Requirement**: Matching compression/decompression algorithms on sender and receiver sides.

### Deduplication

- **Function**: Prevents multiple file copies on the network.
- **Benefit**: Saves hard drive space, improves backup efficiency, and speeds up data recovery.

### Protocol Optimization

- **Objective**: Enhance networking protocol efficiency for high bandwidth and low latency applications.

### Local Caching

- **Mechanism**: Stores copies of network files locally.
- **Application**: Useful for frequently accessed files in specific LAN locations.

### Traffic Shaping

- **Techniques**:
  - **Bandwidth Throttling**: Manages traffic volume during peak times.
  - **Rate Limiting**: Caps maximum data rates.
  - **Complex Algorithms**: Classifies and prioritizes data, favoring important traffic.

## **WAN Protocols**

### Packet Switching

- **Method**: Breaks messages into packets, each with a header for reassembly.
- **Error Correction**: Uses triplication to detect and correct data corruption.

### Frame Relay

- **Technology**: Initially for ISDN lines, now broader application.
- **Method**: Transmits data using packet switching, minimizing error checking needs.

### Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs)

- **Use**: Long-term data connections, always open.

### Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs)

- **Use**: Temporary session connections for sporadic communications.

### Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)

- **Function**: Encodes data in fixed-size cells for long-distance transmission.
- **Status**: Mostly replaced by IP technologies.

### High-Level Data Control (HDLC)

- **Purpose**: Encapsulation protocol for delivering data frames.
- **Modes**:
  - **NRM (Normal Response Mode)**: Primary node grants transmission permission.
  - **ARM (Asynchronous Response Mode)**: Secondary node can initiate communication.
  - **ABM (Asynchronous Balanced Mode)**: Nodes can both initiate communications.

### Packet over SONET/SDH

- **Function**: Defines point-to-point communication over fiber optics.

### Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)

- **Purpose**: Optimizes network routing.
- **Method**: Uses short path labels instead of long network addresses for routing.
