- **Modulation**: Modulation is the process of encoding digital data onto an analog signal. This is done by varying the frequency, amplitude, or phase of the analog signal.
- **Digital Data**: Digital data is data that is represented in binary form. It is a sequence of 0s and 1s.
- **Analog Signal**: An analog signal is a continuous signal that varies in amplitude, frequency, or phase.
- **Duplex Communication**: Duplex communication is a form of communication where data can be transmitted in both directions simultaneously.
- **Simplex Communication**: Simplex communication is a form of communication where data can only be transmitted in one direction.
- **Half-Duplex Communication**: Half-duplex communication is a form of communication where data can be transmitted in both directions, but not simultaneously.
