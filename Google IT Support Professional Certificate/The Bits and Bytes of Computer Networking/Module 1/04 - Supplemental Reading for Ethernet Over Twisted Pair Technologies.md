# Cheatsheet: Ethernet Over Twisted Pair Technologies

## Overview

- **Ethernet over Twisted Pair:** Most common Ethernet cable in business and home networks.
- **Internet Delivery:** Via coaxial or fiber-optic cable from ISP, into a gateway modem, then through twisted pair Ethernet cable to router/computer.
- **CAT Cables:** Ethernet cables also known as CAT5, CAT6, etc.
- **Router Capability:** Can provide both wired and wireless connections.
- **Additional Services:** Can supply telephone and TV services.

## Twisted Pair Cables

- **Original Configuration:** Two copper wires (one for transmitting, one for receiving) laid parallel; prone to EMI, RFI, and crosstalk.
- **Improvement:** Twisting the wire pairs together reduces noise.

## Advantages

- **EMI, RFI, and Crosstalk Protection:** Multiple levels of protection available.
- **Cost:** Low-cost options suitable for home users and small businesses.
- **Physical Attributes:** Thin, lightweight, and easily installable.
- **Range:** Suitable for short distance connections within buildings and homes.
- **Frequency Range:** Transmits both data and telephone/voice communications.

## Types of Ethernet Cables

### UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)

- **Common Use:** Most common and least expensive.
- **Protection Level:** Basic protection against interference.

### STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)

- **Usage:** Environments with high EMI, RFI, and crosstalk.
- **Shielding:** Braided aluminum/copper shielding.

### FTP (Foiled Twisted Pair)

- **Usage:** Similar to STP; used in high interference environments.
- **Shielding:** Thin foil shield around wire bundle.

### SF/FTP (Shielded Foiled Twisted Pair)

- **Usage:** Industrial environments with very high EMI/RFI.
- **Shielding:** Combination of braided and foil shields.

## Straight-Through Cable

- **Other Name:** Patch cables.
- **Primary Use:** Connects computers, routers, hubs, and switches.
- **Identification:** Same color and stripe order at both ends.
- **100Base-T Standards:** Typically do not use blue and brown wires.
- **Gigabit Ethernet:** May use blue and brown wires for Power over Ethernet (PoE).

### Key Pin Usage

- **Computers and Routers:**

  - Pins 1 & 2: Orange wires (sending data)
  - Pins 3 & 6: Green wires (receiving data)

- **Hubs and Switches:**
  - Pins 1 & 2: Green wires (sending data)
  - Pins 3 & 6: Orange wires (receiving data)
