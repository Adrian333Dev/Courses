# The Basics of Networking Devices

## Cables

### Most Common Cable Types

- **Copper**
  - Most common forms of copper twisted pair cables are **Cat 5, Cat 5e, Cat 6**.
- **Fiber Optic**

### Cables - Terms

- **Crosstalk**: Crosstalk is when an electrical pulse on one wire is accidentally detected on another wire, so the receiving end isn't able to understand the data causing a network error.

## Hubs and Switches

### Hubs and Switches - Terms

- **Data Collision**: A collision domain is a network segment where only one device can communicate at a time. If multiple systems try sending data at the same time, the electrical pulses sent across the cable can interfere with each other. This causes these systems to have to wait for a quiet period before they try sending their data again., marked from 0 hours 0 minutes 59 seconds until 0 hours 1 minutes 18 secondsA collision domain is a network segment where only one device can communicate at a time.

## Routers

### Routers - Terms

- **Routers**: A router, is a device that knows how to forward data between independent networks. While a hub is a layer one device and a switch is a layer two device.
