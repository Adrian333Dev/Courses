# Module 1 Glossary

## New terms and their definitions: Course 2 Module 1

**Bit:** The smallest representation of data that a computer can understand.

**Border Gateway Protocol (BGP):** A protocol by which routers share data with each other.

**Broadcast:** A type of Ethernet transmission, sent to every single device on a LAN.

**Broadcast address:** A special destination used by an Ethernet broadcast composed of all Fs.

**Cable categories:** Groups of cables made with the same material. Most network cables used today can be split into two categories, copper and fiber.

**Cables:** Insulated wires that connect different devices, allowing data to be transmitted over them.

**Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD):** Determines when communication channels are clear and when a device is free to transmit data.

**Client:** A device that receives data from a server.

**Collision domain:** A network segment where only one device can communicate at a time.

**Computer networking:** The full scope of how computers communicate with each other.

**Copper cable categories:** These categories have different physical characteristics like the number of twists in the pair of copper wires. These are defined as category (or cat) 5, 5e, or 6, and how quickly data can be sent across them and how resistant they are to outside interference are all related to the way the twisted pairs inside are arranged.

**Crosstalk:** When an electrical pulse on one wire is accidentally detected on another wire.

**Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC):** A mathematical transformation using polynomial division to create a number representing a larger set of data. It is crucial for data integrity in computing, not just network transmissions.

**Data packet:** An all-encompassing term representing any single set of binary data being sent across a network link.

**Datalink layer:** The layer in which the first protocols are introduced. Responsible for defining a common way of interpreting signals so network devices can communicate.

**Destination MAC address:** The hardware address of the intended recipient, immediately following the start frame delimiter.

**Duplex communication:** Information can flow in both directions across a cable.

**Ethernet:** The protocol most widely used to send data across individual links.

**Ethernet frame:** A highly structured collection of information presented in a specific order.

**EtherType field:** Follows the Source MAC Address in a data frame. It is 16 bits long and describes the protocol of the frame's contents.

**Fiber cable:** Contains individual optical fibers, tiny tubes of glass about the width of a human hair. Uses pulses of light to represent data instead of electrical voltages.

**Five layer model:** Explains how network devices communicate through five layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, and Application.

**Frame check sequence:** A 4-byte or 32-bit number representing a checksum value for the entire frame.

**Full duplex:** Devices on either side of a networking link can communicate simultaneously.

**Half-duplex:** Communication is possible in each direction, but only one device can communicate at a time.

**Hexadecimal:** A way to represent numbers using a numerical base of 16.

**Hub:** A physical layer device that broadcasts data to every computer connected to it.

**Internet Protocol (IP):** The most common protocol used in the network layer.

**Internet Service Provider (ISP):** A company that provides internet connections to consumers.

**Internetwork:** A collection of networks connected through routers, with the most famous being the Internet.

**Line coding:** Modulation used for computer networks.

**Local Area Network (LAN):** A single network in which multiple devices are connected.

**MAC (Media Access Control) address:** A globally unique identifier attached to an individual network interface. It is a 48-bit number usually represented by six groups of two hexadecimal numbers.

**Modulation:** Varying the voltage of a constant electrical charge moving across a standard copper network cable.

**Multicast frame:** If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to one, it indicates a multicast frame, which is sent to all devices on the local network but only accepted or discarded by devices based on criteria other than their own MAC address.

**Network layer:** Allows different networks to communicate through routers, responsible for data delivery across networks.

**Network port:** The physical connector to connect a device to the network, either attached to a device, on a wall, or on a patch panel.

**Network switch:** A level 2 or data link device connecting many devices to communicate. Inspects Ethernet protocol data and directs it to the correct system.

**Node:** Any device connected to a network, typically acting as a server or a client.

**Octet:** Any number represented by 8 bits.

**Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI):** The first three octets of a MAC address.

**OSI model:** Defines how network devices communicate through seven layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

**Patch panel:** A device containing many physical network ports.

**Payload:** The actual data being transported, excluding the header.

**Physical layer:** Represents the physical devices interconnecting computers.

**Preamble:** The first part of an Ethernet frame, 8 bytes or 64 bits long, split into two sections.

**Protocol:** A defined set of standards for computers to communicate properly.

**Router:** A device that forwards data between independent networks.

**Server:** A device that provides data to another requesting device (client).

**Simplex communication:** Data communication that only goes in one direction across a cable.

**Source MAC address:** The hardware address of the device that sent the Ethernet frame or data packet, following the destination MAC address.

**Start Frame Delimiter (SFD):** The last byte in the preamble, signaling the end of the preamble and the start of the frame contents.

**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):** A data transfer protocol in the fourth layer, requiring an established connection between client and server.

**Transport layer:** Sorts out which client and server programs should receive the data.

**Twisted pair cable:** The most common type of cabling for connecting computing devices, featuring pairs of twisted copper wires.

**Unicast transmission:** Meant for just one receiving address.

**User Datagram Protocol (UDP):** A transfer protocol not relying on connections, without acknowledgments, sending data to a specified port.

**Virtual LAN (VLAN):** Allows multiple logical LANs on the same physical equipment.

**VLAN header:** Indicates what the frame itself is, followed by the EtherType field in a data packet.
