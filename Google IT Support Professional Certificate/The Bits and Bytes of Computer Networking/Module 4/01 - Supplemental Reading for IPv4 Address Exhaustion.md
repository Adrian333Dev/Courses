# IPv4 Address Exhaustion - Cheatsheet

## Overview

- **IP Address Usage**: Essential for testing network connections and device issues.
- **IANA Role**: Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) distributes unique IP addresses.
- **Address Shortage**: Rapid internet growth has depleted the 4.2 billion available IPv4 addresses.

## Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)

IANA assigns IP blocks to five RIRs based on geographical regions:

1. **AFRINIC** - Africa
2. **ARIN** - USA, Canada, parts of the Caribbean
3. **APNIC** - Most of Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Pacific Islands
4. **LACNIC** - Central/South America, remaining Caribbean
5. **RIPE NCC** - Europe, Russia, Middle East, parts of Central Asia

## Timeline of IPv4 Exhaustion

- **APNIC**: Exhausted its final /8 in April 2011.
- **RIPE NCC**: Exhausted its final /8 in September 2012.
- **LACNIC**: Exhausted its final /10 in June 2014.
- **ARIN**: Exhausted its IPv4 addresses in September 2015.
- **AFRINIC**: Entered IPv4 Exhaustion Phase 2 in January 2020.

## Transition to IPv6

- **IPv6 Introduction**: Uses 128-bit addresses, offering a vast number of IP addresses.
- **IPv6 Benefits**: Solves IPv4 address exhaustion and supports the growing number of devices.
- **Current Usage**: Despite IPv6 availability, 99% of devices still use IPv4.

## Key Takeaways

- **IPv4 Exhaustion**: The 4.2 billion IPv4 addresses are nearly exhausted.
- **RIRs' Role**: RIRs assign IP addresses within their regions.
- **IPv6 Transition**: Provides a solution to address shortages, with ongoing adoption necessary.
